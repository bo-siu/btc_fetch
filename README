This project is designed for fetching and storing of bitcoin transaction data. As far now, the following platform is
taken:

1. OKCOIN   http://okcoin.cn
2. HUOBI    http://huobi.com

Those data is fetched via REST by default. For https instance, we allow all https connection by making fake certificate.
For data storing, we use mongodb as our database.
